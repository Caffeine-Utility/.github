## About Caffeine

Caffeine provides an elegant solution to a common productivity frustration: computers entering sleep mode at inconvenient times during important tasks, presentations, or extended processes. This lightweight utility operates discreetly from your menu bar or system tray, allowing you to temporarily override system power management settings with a single click. By simulating user activity at the system level, Caffeine keeps your computer awake and alert without requiring constant mouse movement or keyboard input, ensuring that downloads complete, presentations run smoothly, and long-running processes continue uninterrupted.

The application excels in its simplicity and reliability, providing essential functionality without unnecessary complexity or system resource consumption. Caffeine's intuitive interface presents clear visual indicators of its active state while offering flexible timing options that cater to different use cases—from brief presentations to overnight maintenance tasks. With its ability to separately control display sleep and system sleep, users can maintain visibility during presentations while allowing the system to conserve power when appropriate. This thoughtful balance between functionality and simplicity makes Caffeine an indispensable tool for professionals, presenters, developers, and anyone who needs reliable control over their computer's sleep behavior without navigating through multiple system preference panels.
